# Char-Line-Culator

This repository contains a Windows Forms Application named "Char-Line-Culator." This project represents one of my very first activities during my early days in school as a beginner in programming. While it may not boast intricate design or advanced features, it holds sentimental value as a significant milestone in my coding journey. This simple calculator allows users to input length, width, margins, point size, and spacing preferences, providing a basic yet functional tool for early explorations in page layout planning.
